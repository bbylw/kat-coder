# Project Overview: KAT-Coder Website

This project appears to be a static website, likely serving as a landing page or a simple informational site. It includes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for potential interactivity. The project also contains documentation files, suggesting it might be a template or a project with detailed explanations.

## Key Files:

*   `index.html`: The main entry point of the website.
*   `styles.css`: Contains the styling rules for the website, now updated with a Ukrainian theme.
*   `script.js`: Contains JavaScript for client-side interactivity.
*   `documentation.html`: Provides additional documentation or information about the project.
*   `assets/hero-image.png`: An image used in the hero section of the website.

## Building and Running:

This is a static website, so no special build steps are required. To run the website, simply open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Development Conventions:

*   **Styling:** The website uses a custom CSS file (`styles.css`) for its visual presentation. The current theme is Ukrainian-inspired, using blue (`#005BBB`) and yellow (`#FFD700`).
*   **Structure:** The HTML follows a standard structure with `header`, `main`, and `footer` sections.
*   **Scripting:** JavaScript is used for client-side enhancements, as seen in `script.js`.

## UI/UX Optimization and Ukrainian Theme:

The website has been optimized with a Ukrainian theme, incorporating the national colors:

*   **Blue (`#005BBB`):** Used for backgrounds of the header, footer, and hero section.
*   **Yellow (`#FFD700`):** Used for text in the header, footer, navigation links, and as the main background color for the body.

This color scheme provides a distinct and vibrant visual identity to the website.
